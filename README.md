HOARSE : HOrseback ARchery SoftwarE
===================================

Hoarse is a project that aims at providing a multiplatform
(Windows / Mac / Linux / iOS / Android)  software solution
for managing Horseback Archery competitions.

It allows you to define the settings for your competition, 
then simply input the times and target points for each competitor 
and each run, and final scores and ranking are automatically computer.
It is designed to reduce human errors occurring frequently when using 
an Excel file, and to be as easy to use as possible. A final Excel 
document is produced for you to save and share. 

Predefined styles include French Federal styles and most common 
IHAA styles (Hungarian and Korean). 

Future improvements may include: being able to import a past list
of competitors, to save your own custom styles in json/xml, to 
define a combined competition and how you wish to combine scores, 
to define a team competition.

The software name is an homage to the voices of all horseback archery
competition judges worldwide, trying to get heard over long distances 
for getting things to run smoothly. Thank you so much for your dedication. 

For now, it's just a WIP.
